1.Data processing in 3D space is more challenging than 2D image processing.

the reason is as follows:

1.1 3D data has one more dimension than 2D data and, hence, has a larger memory footprint.

1.2 The neighborhood in 3D space is more complex than an 8-neighborhood in 2D images.

2. Why is the deep learning extremely challenging in 3D space?

Beacuse deep learning not only needs large datasets for training but is already resource hungry in 2D space.
