Almost once a week broadcasts about earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, or forest fires are
filling the news. While oneself feels it is hard to watch such news, it is even harder for rescue
troops to enter these areas. They need some skills to get a quick overview of the devastated
area and find victims. Time is ticking, since the chance for survival shrinks the longer it takes
till help is available. To coordinate the teams efficiently, all information needs to be collected
at the command center. Therefore, teams investigate the destroyed houses and hollow spaces
for victims. Doing so, they never can be sure that the building will not fully collapse while they
are inside. Here, rescue robots are welcome helpers, as they are replaceable and make work
more secure. Unfortunately, rescue robots are not usable off-the-shelf, yet.
There is no doubt, that such a robot has to fulfil essential requirements to successfully
accomplish a rescue mission. Apart from the mechanical requirements it has to be able to build
a 3D map of the environment. This is essential to navigate through rough terrain and fulfil
manipulation tasks (e.g. open doors). To build a map and gather environmental information,
robots are equipped with multiple sensors. Since laser scanners produce precise measurements
and support a wide scanning range, they are common visual sensors utilized for mapping.
